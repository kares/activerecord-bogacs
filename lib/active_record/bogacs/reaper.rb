    # Every +frequency+ seconds, the reaper will "reap" a pool it belongs to.
    # Reaping means detecting stale cached connections in the pool - those that
    # were checked-out by a thread but never checked back in after the thread
    # finished/died.
    #
    # @note This version is fail safe - raised errors won't stop the reaping process.
    # Instead the thread will be restarted and reaping continues at the next tick.
    #
    # Configure the frequency by setting `:reaping_frequency` in your database yaml file.
