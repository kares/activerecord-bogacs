    # == Obtaining (checking out) a connection
    #
    # Connections can be obtained and used from a connection pool in several
    # ways:
    #
    # 1. Simply use ActiveRecord::Base.connection as with Active Record 2.1 and
    # earlier (pre-connection-pooling). Eventually, when you're done with
    # the connection(s) and wish it to be returned to the pool, you call
    # ActiveRecord::Base.clear_active_connections!.
    # 2. Manually check out a connection from the pool with
    # ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.checkout. You are responsible for
    # returning this connection to the pool when finished by calling
    # ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.checkin(connection).
    # 3. Use ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.with_connection(&block), which
    # obtains a connection, yields it as the sole argument to the block,
    # and returns it to the pool after the block completes.
    #
    # Connections in the pool are actually AbstractAdapter objects (or objects
    # compatible with AbstractAdapter's interface).
    #
    # == Options
    #
    # There are several connection-pooling-related options that you can add to
    # your database connection configuration:
    #
    # * **pool**: number indicating size of connection pool (default 5)
    # * **checkout_timeout**: number of seconds to block and wait for a connection
    # before giving up and raising a timeout error (default 5 seconds).
    # * **pool_initial**: number of connections to pre-initialize when the pool
    # is created (default 0).
    # * **reaping_frequency**: frequency in seconds to periodically run a reaper,
    # which attempts to find and close "dead" connections (can occur if a caller
    # forgets to close a connection at the end of a thread or a thread dies unexpectedly)
    # Default is `nil`, which means don't run the periodical Reaper at all (reaping
    # will still happen occasionally).
    class DefaultPool
      # Threadsafe, fair, FIFO queue. Meant to be used by ConnectionPool
      # with which it shares a Monitor. But could be a generic Queue.
      #
      # The Queue in stdlib's 'thread' could replace this class except
      # stdlib's doesn't support waiting with a timeout.
